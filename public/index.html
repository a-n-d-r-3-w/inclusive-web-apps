    <h1>Inclusive Web Apps</h1>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <h2>What are inclusive web apps?</h2>
    <p>
      Inclusive web apps are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Accessible</b>: They conform to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">
            Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines (WCAG)</a> so that they are more accessible to people with
          disabilities such as visual, cognitive, neurological.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Low cost to use</b>: The apps are currently free to use and we
          welcome <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/inclusive">donations</a>
          to help offset operating costs. If operating costs become
          unsustainable, we will adjust this approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Performant on slow network connections</b>: Not everybody has a
          fiber-optic gigabit internet connection. Users might live or be
          traveling in an area where a high-speed connection is either not available or
          not affordable. Inclusive Web Apps are written to be performant for
          users with limited bandwidth. There are no ads, trackers, or analytics
          that waste bandwidth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legible and usable on small screens</b>: Not everybody has or wants a phone with a 6.7" display. Content should be not truncated on small displays, and users should not be required to scroll horizontally. Content should also not be simply shrunk to fit onto a small screen, because then the user has to zoom in and scroll horizontally anyways.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>What apps are included here?</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>About Others</b>: Take notes about people you've met to help grow personal relationships.</li>
        <li><b>Good Habits</b>: Track progress on habits you are trying to develop.</li>
        <li><b>Good Memories</b>: Write about good days or events. You'll be shown a random one each time you log in.</li>
        <li><b>Meditation Timer</b>: Select a duration and the app will produce a non-alarming sound to indicate the beginning and end of the session.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>How do I start using the apps?</h2>
    <p>
      If you are new to this website, then <a href="/create-account.html">create an account</a>. If you have an account, then <a href="/log-in.html">log in</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Why does the website look so plain?</h2>
    <p>
      Resources are limited. Not only our web app-development resources, but also
      your network bandwidth and device battery life. We choose to focus our
      resources on inclusive web design and implementation. We could instead focus on making
      the website look fancy with rounded buttons,
      subtle colors, and animations, but this is more code that consumes your
      device's network bandwidth and battery life, and sometimes such features
      hinder accessibility. There are enough people out there who prioritize
      aesthetics and flair. We need more people to prioritize inclusiveness.
